Persistence V1:
- Save Chat: After sending to all clients, post AWS RDS via Go Service
- Schemas:
    user{id, name}
    message{id, senderID, raw, morse, plaintext, timestamp}

Dockerfication: Automation of setup, build and run processes
- Setup Docker containers for frontend, backend
- Create an ez single execution to run the whole thing for devs or repo visitors

CI: (No CD b/c deployment cancelled)
- On git push, run test scripts on frontend & backend containers

Persistence V2:
- Replace AWS RDS dependency for a generic one
- Dockerize

Deployment: (CANCELLED DUE TO AWS COSTs $$$)
- Separate Vercel Projects for frontend and backend
- Separate both into different directories
- Re-design to accomodate for downtime of either
    - Explicit connect/reconnect buttons
    - Reconnecting scripts with loading spinner displayed

APIs (NOT READY)
- Frontend requests Backend API (Go Service) for chat logs JSON
- Secure the enpoints 

Visual Logger (Toggle btn + large text field)
- displays logs in a frontend & backend box on screen
to give technical insight for the dev viewing it
- Use a dedicated ws to transfer logs from Go to React

Login: (NOT READY)
- User creation
- Authentication

Messaging Change
- Instead of ws, use a message broker (more scalable) for pub-sub
    -> RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, etc

Cache (NOT READY)
- Use Redis (stores in server memory, might use clusters)
- Modify fetching Go service to check cache first

(go cloud might be useful)
Group Chats: (NOT READY)
- use pub/sub logic in go
- update persistence and cache
